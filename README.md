# Employee Directory app with Thymeleaf template (CRUD)

To performing all CRUD methods on the database we used SPRING DATA JPA for DAO(Repository) layer.

On the client side we can show list employee objects retrieved from the database.

We also have a button “Add Employee” and when we click on that button a new form opens for adding a new employee and when we click on button Save, that employee object will be saved to the database.
